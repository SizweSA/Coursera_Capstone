Data

To help Ababa Coffee in making an informed decision about the best location to setup the business offices in Johannesburg, the Data
Scientits we will need to access following data:

1) The Boroughs/Regions and Neighbourhoods/Suburbs of Johannesburg from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg. 
We will make us of the BeautifulSoup Python package to scrape this Wikipedia website and transform the data about the City of 
Johannesburg including all its Boroughs/Regions and Neighbourhoods/Suburbs into a Pandas dataframe.

2) The GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude) of the these Boroughs/Regions and Neighbourhoods/Suburbs of Johannesburg. We will use 
   the Geocoder Python package to get these coordinates.

3) From Foursquare API we require the following venues data:
 - the Coffee Shops venues of the Johannesburg Neighbourhoods
 - the Restaurants venues of the Johannesburg Neighbourhoods
 - the Diners venues of the Johannesburg Neighbourhoods
 - the Fast Foods Outlets venues of the Johannesburg Neighbourhoods
 - the Grocery Shop venues of the Johannesburg Neighbourhoods
 - the Supermarkets venues of the Johannesburg Neighbourhoods

We will then leverage the above data in order to determine which Johannesburg Neighbourhood is the most appropriate in order to 
locate the offices for Ababa Coffee in Johannesburg, South Africa.
